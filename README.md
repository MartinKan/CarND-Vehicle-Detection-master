[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Background
---
In this project, my goal is to train a classifier to identify the vehicles in a video.

Overview of Repository
---
This repository contains the following files that I will be submitting for the vehicle detection project:

1.  [detect.py](https://github.com/MartinKan/CarND-Vehicle-Detection-master/blob/master/detect.py)
2.  [helper_functions.py](https://github.com/MartinKan/CarND-Vehicle-Detection-master/blob/master/helper_functions.py)
2.  [project_writeup.md](https://github.com/MartinKan/CarND-Vehicle-Detection-master/blob/master/project_writeup.md)
3.  [project_video_final.mp4](https://github.com/MartinKan/CarND-Vehicle-Detection-master/blob/master/output_images/project_video_final.mp4)

The first file is the vehicle detection program that I have written for the project.

The second file contains the helper functions that are referenced in the vehicle detection program.

The third file is a written report for my project that addresses each of the rubric points for the project.

The fourth file is the final video output when the project_video.mp4 file was fed through my vehicle detection program (detect.py).
